Hello! This is my first program and this is calculator!
if you want to do exe too just install pyinstaller(pip install pyinstaller) and wheel(pip istall wheel) and specify the path to the folder where the program is located and write pyinstaller your app name
if you want one file just before your name app write -F
if you want do your program with icon just before your name app write -i "path to the folder where the program is located\icon_name.ico" 
-F and -i can be together
ICON MUST BE ICO(name_icon.ico)!!!
